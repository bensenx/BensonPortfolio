# Multi-Material MIP-SLA 3D Printer


<img border="rounded" src="images/multi-material2.jpg" width = 600>

I designed, prototyped and fabricated the optical and material feeding system of this multi-material printer. An 100W industrial UV light LED was utilized to provide a collimated light beam that passes through a DMD device to form images. 

---

The Printing Plate was composed of a sealed cylinder with multiple inlets and outlets driven by a peristaltic pump to achieve material switch.

</div>

I designed and built the material feeding and temperature control system to upgrade this printer for dental application. This device was specially designed for viscous materials such as temporary dental polymers.

A scraping blade with a fine-turning linear stage was employed to create 75 μm layers for printing. 

A PID controlled infrared heating system was utilized to keep the temperature in 70-80 ℃.

</div>

A showcase of a micron-level DLP printer model I drew with Solidworks and Rendered with Keyshot. The extra precise z direction linear stage was able to support printing layers in μm level.

</div>

This is a model drawn with Solidworks for 3D printing a special helmet with hexagon pattern. Those patterns are designed for mounting coils that improve MRI image quality.
